        <p>You grab the pocketwatch before it gets away.</p>
        <p>As soon as you grab it, everything seems to return to normal.</p>
        <p>But, it looks less advanced. There's still shining lights, screens and signs, but they don't have the same quality as before.</p>
        <p>You look at your bright phone screen, but it says that there's no service. The time and date still looks just like before.</p>
        <p>You check the pocketwatch, but now only the seconds hand is working.</p>
        <p>Checking your surroundings you see a nearby tv through a window that has the news on.</p>
        <p>You don't recongnise the channel, but the it says the date is November 12, 2000.</p>
        <p>This can't be real. How did this happen? How are you supposed to get back home?</p>
        <p>After realizing this started after picking up the pocketwatch, you check the back and see it has small screws holding the back plate.</p>
        <p>New Objective: Go Find a Screwdriver.</p>
        <p>Where do you want to go?</p>
