        <p>Arriving at the Medieval times, you find yourself in a town.</p>
        <p>There seems to be a blacksmith nearby, and thinking a part is likely there, you head inside.</p>
        <p>You speak to the blacksmith, asking if he's seen anything that looks like a part you need.</p>
        <p>He responds with talking in a strange form of english and pulling out a part from his pocket.</p>
        <p>He seems willing to give it to you, but is wanting something in return.</p>
        <p>You offer him some coins, but he doesn't seem very interested in what you have.</p>
        <p>When would you like to travel to next?</p>

        <p>You bring him the strange rock, and the blacksmith seems to be interested in it.</p>
