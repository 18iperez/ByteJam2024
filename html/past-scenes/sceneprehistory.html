        <p>Realizing the opportunity to do so, you travel to the prehistoric era.</p>
        <p>You wonder if you can find anything interesting to bring back with you.</p>
        <p>After looking around for a minute, you realize that this may have not been a smart choice.</p>
        <p>You have no idea where you are, and you don't know anything about the creatures near you.</p>
        <p>There's no way that there could be a part for the stopwatch here.</p>
        <p>You could continue exploring here, but there's no reason to right now.</p>
        <p>When would you like to travel to next?</p>

         <p>After looking around, you notice a cave nearby.</p>
         <p>You enter the cave, and turn on your phone's flashlight.</p>
         <p>Eventually, the only light in the cave is from your flashlight.</p>
         <p>Searching through the darkness, you find a strange metal rock.</p>
         <p>However, you find what seems to be a dinosaur sleeping in a nest near the rock.</p>
         <p>Sneaking quietly, you grab the strange rock and get out of the cave before the creature wakes up.</p>
         <p>You got the strange rock!</p>
