        <p>At the Hardware Store, you look around for a Screwdriver small enough to fit the pocketwatch.</p>
        <p>You find one that will work, and buy it with the money you have on hand.</p>
        <p>Unscrewing the back of the plate reveals a piece of paper with instructions on how to fix it, and how to use it!</p>
        <p>The instructions also state that if some parts are broken, time travel is limited. 
            However, whenever and wherever you travel to will have a part or something needed to get a part.</p>
        <p>It looks like you'll need to find three parts to fully fix it. </p>
        <p>After looking around in the store for a bit, you find a part for the pocketwatch!</p>
        <p id="collectPieceMessage">You buy the part and put it in the watch.</p>
        <p>It seems like you might be able to time travel, but only to a few points in time until it is fully fixed.</p>
        <p>When would you like to travel to next?</p>
