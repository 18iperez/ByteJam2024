        <p>You notice a jewelry store down the street. Maybe there will be a part there.</p>
        <p>Looking inside, there seems to be a part on display. The shopkeeper says that he found it recently and was thinking of using it in a necklace.</p>
        <p>You offer $25 for the part by itself. He is suprised that you have that much money on hand and are willing to give it away.</p>
        <p>The shopkeeper gives you the part, and says that since you seem to be a weathly client, he offers a position in "the family business".</p>
        <p>You decline his offer and leave before anything happens.</p>
